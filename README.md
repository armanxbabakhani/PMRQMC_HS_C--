## Introduction

This program PMRQMC.cpp simulates the equilibrium quantities for a specified Hamiltonian (using an input file). The only simulation parameter is the inverse temperature of the system that can be altered directly by editing PMRQMC.cpp file (it is set to $\beta = 1$ by default).
This code takes in an input file specifying the Hamiltonian in sum of pauli strings.
The code consists of two parts, descibed as follows.

## The Code

### A. Data to PMR (DatatoPMR.h)

This header file provides all the necessary functions to convert the pauli string input data provided by the user into PMR representation. The data structure describing the PMR formalism is as follows
